<h2>Simple Website Screenshot | Usage</h2>
<br /><br />
It's Time to Try my brand new "<em>Simple Website Screenshot</em>" Plugin.<br /><br />
I think that it's the most simple plugin make a website screenshot. <br /><br />
First thing you need to do after the plugin's installation is the plugin Setup.<br /><br /><br />
<ul>
<li>---> Click on "Sws Setting" on the left and insert the "width" and the "height" of screenshot you'll make <br />according with your template dimension.</li>
<li>---> Click on "Save Settings"</li>
<li>---> Watch the "Live Preview" at bottom of the page; if preview satisfies yourself YOU'VE DONE; If not, make change.</li>
<li>---> After Saving you can Click on "Add Post", then change to "HTML" mode and Write: <b>[screenshot url="www.website.est"]</b></li>
<li>---> Say Thanks to me and MATT or Make a Donation ;-)</li>
</ul>
